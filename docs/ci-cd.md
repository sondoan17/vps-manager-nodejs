# CI/CD

This repository uses GitHub Actions for verification, Docker image publishing, and optional SSH deployment.

## Workflow

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Pull requests

Pull requests run conditional verification: image build, image scan, and SBOM steps run only when the corresponding API or web paths change (or a workflow dispatch force input is selected). Pull requests do not publish images to GHCR and do not run the production deploy job.

Every pull request runs:

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm test`
3. `npm run typecheck`
4. `npm run build`
5. `bash scripts/tests/test-installer-docker-access.sh`
6. `docker compose config --quiet`
7. `npm run test:agent -- --race` (with `CGO_ENABLED=1`)
8. Docker build checks for both runtime targets:
   - API image target: `api-runtime`
   - Web image target: `web-runtime`
9. When an API or web image is built, independent report-only Trivy scans and SBOM generation run for both applicable images; reports are uploaded even if findings occur, then a final gate fails on fixable CRITICAL findings.
10. PostgreSQL migration integration test

The `publish` job runs only on pushes to `main` (and equivalent non-PR workflow dispatches). It always builds and publishes both API and web images using the current commit SHA, regardless of verification path filters. Pull requests never publish images or deploy.

### Pushes to `main`

Pushes to `main` run the same verification steps, then publish two Docker images to GHCR with the current commit SHA only (no `latest` tag for deployment):

- API:
  - `ghcr.io/sondoan17/vps-manager-nodejs-api:<commit-sha>`
- Web:
  - `ghcr.io/sondoan17/vps-manager-nodejs-web:<commit-sha>`

Deploy uses exactly the image references from the publish outputs. Rollback is reproducible by redeploying the image for an earlier commit SHA.

After publishing, the workflow can deploy over SSH if deployment secrets are configured.

## Runtime topology

The production deployment runs three containers:

- `postgres`: TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL database on the internal Docker network; stores data in a Docker volume.
- `api`: NestJS API on internal port `3000`; stores data in Docker volumes.
- `web`: Nginx static web server on host port `3000`; proxies `/api/*` to `api:3000` and serves the SPA fallback.

The production docker-compose binds the web container to `127.0.0.1:3000` so it listens only on the loopback interface. An external HTTPS reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel) must terminate TLS and forward to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. The API health endpoint is reachable through the web proxy at `/api/health`.

## Required secrets for deployment

Set these in GitHub repository settings:

`Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `Repository secrets`

| Secret                     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VPS_HOST`                 | Yes      | Server IP or hostname.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `VPS_USER`                 | Yes      | SSH user, for example `root`.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `VPS_SSH_KEY`              | Yes      | Private SSH key with access to the server.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `DASHBOARD_SESSION_SECRET` | Yes      | Secret for dashboard session token hashing. Required when `APP_MODE=local`.                                                                                                                       |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`        | Yes      | Password for the `vps_manager` PostgreSQL user. Used on first DB volume initialization and by the API `DATABASE_URL`.                                                                             |
| `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | No       | Plaintext dashboard admin password. If set, the deploy step pipes it to `set-dashboard-password.js --stdin --skip-if-same` after migrations. If unset, the password must be set manually via SSH. |
| `VPS_KNOWN_HOSTS`          | No       | Pinned SSH known_hosts entry. If set, written directly to `known_hosts` instead of `ssh-keyscan` (TOFU). Recommended for production.                                                              |
| `VPS_PORT`                 | No       | SSH port. Defaults to `22`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `DEPLOY_PATH`              | No       | Remote app directory. Defaults to `/opt/vps-manager-nodejs`.                                                                                                                                      |

If the required SSH secrets are missing, the deploy job exits successfully and prints a skip message.

Optional repository variables can override generated server `.env` values:

## Server requirements

The target server needs:

- Docker
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`)
- SSH access using the configured key
- Access to pull from `ghcr.io` during the deployment workflow

The workflow writes a production `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` into `DEPLOY_PATH`. Secrets from GitHub Actions are written to the server-side `.env` file with `chmod 600`; compose services load it with `env_file`.

Then the workflow runs:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d postgres
docker compose run --rm api node dist/db/migrate.js
# Optional and non-fatal:
docker compose run --rm api node dist/db/migrate.js --include-optional || true
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
docker compose ps
```

After the first deploy (if `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` was not set), set the dashboard admin password via SSH:

```bash
# Safer: read password from stdin without showing in process list
# (paste or pipe the password when prompted)
printf 'Dashboard password: ' > /dev/tty && read -rs password && printf '%s\n' "$password" | docker compose -f /opt/vps-manager-nodejs/docker-compose.yml run --rm api node dist/scripts/set-dashboard-password.js --stdin && unset password
```

Alternatively, set the `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` GitHub Secret and redeploy — the CI workflow will bootstrap it automatically.

To rotate the password without downtime, pipe the new password with `--skip-if-same`:

```bash
printf 'New password: ' > /dev/tty && read -rs password && printf '%s\n' "$password" | docker compose -f /opt/vps-manager-nodejs/docker-compose.yml run --rm api node dist/scripts/set-dashboard-password.js --stdin --skip-if-same && unset password
```

The `--skip-if-same` flag avoids unnecessary session revocations when the password hasn't changed (e.g., re-running the deploy CI without changing the secret).

The database password is stored in the server-side `.env` file for this single-host deployment. To rotate it after the `vps-manager-postgres` volume exists, update the DB user password with `ALTER USER`, update the GitHub secret, then redeploy.

## Manual run

The workflow supports `workflow_dispatch`, so it can be run manually from the GitHub Actions tab.
